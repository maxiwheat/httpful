[![Total Downloads](https://poser.pugx.org/maxiwheat/httpful/downloads.png)](https://packagist.org/packages/maxiwheat/httpful)

Httpful is a simple Http Client library for PHP 7.2+.  There is an emphasis of readability, simplicity, and flexibility â€“ basically provide the features and flexibility to get the job done and make those features really easy to use.

Features

 - Readable HTTP Method Support (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, HEAD, PATCH and OPTIONS)
 - Custom Headers
 - Automatic "Smart" Parsing
 - Automatic Payload Serialization
 - Basic Auth
 - Client Side Certificate Auth
 - Request "Templates"

# Sneak Peak

Here's something to whet your appetite.  Search the twitter API for tweets containing "#PHP".  Include a trivial header for the heck of it.  Notice that the library automatically interprets the response as JSON (can override this if desired) and parses it as an array of objects.

```php
// Make a request to the GitHub API with a custom
// header of "X-Trvial-Header: Just as a demo".
$url = "https://api.github.com/users/maxiwheat";
$response = src\Request::get($url)
    ->expectsJson()
    ->withXTrivialHeader('Just as a demo')
    ->send();

echo "{$response->body->name} joined GitHub on " .
                        date('M jS', strtotime($response->body->created_at)) ."\n";
```
